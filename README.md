## Welcome to the Duty Rooster Repo!#
This is a graphical web-app to assist the arrangement of duty rosters. Welcome all to contribute!
I always felt like it would be better if there was a duty roster website for me to plan shifts.
Hence, I created this project to help everyone out there who's just like me!
